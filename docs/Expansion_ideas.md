# Expansion Ideas for SharkByte

## UX/UI Improvements Based on Common CAM Workflow Pain Points

### Workflow Guidance & Onboarding
- **Step-by-step wizard for first-time users**: Guide through device setup ’ file import ’ tool selection ’ operation setup ’ simulation ’ export
- **Progress indicators**: Show current step in the CAM workflow (Setup ’ CAM ’ Preview ’ Export)
- **Contextual tutorials**: Pop-up guidance based on current operation being performed
- **Template workflows**: Pre-configured operation sequences for common CNC Shark tasks (sign making, pocketing, v-carving)

### Smart Defaults & CNC Shark Optimization
- **Intelligent tool selection**: Auto-suggest appropriate tools based on material and operation type
- **Feeds & speeds calculator**: Built-in calculator with CNC Shark HD4-specific recommendations
- **Material presets**: Pre-configured settings for common materials (pine, oak, MDF, aluminum, etc.)
- **Operation templates**: One-click setups for common operations (sign relief, through cuts, edge profiling)

### Visual Feedback & Error Prevention
- **Real-time collision detection**: Highlight potential crashes before simulation
- **Tool path validation**: Visual warnings for problematic moves (rapid into material, excessive step-down)
- **Workholding visualization**: Show clamp positions and potential conflicts
- **Cut depth indicators**: Visual representation of cut depths relative to material thickness

### Context-Sensitive Help
- **Smart tooltips**: Context-aware help that adapts to current tool, material, and operation
- **Parameter explanations**: Plain-English descriptions of technical settings (stepover, stepdown, etc.)
- **Common issues detection**: Automatically flag settings that commonly cause problems
- **Quick fixes**: One-click solutions for detected issues

### Workflow Streamlining
- **Batch operations**: Apply same operation to multiple objects with different parameters
- **Operation chaining**: Automatic sequencing of roughing ’ semi-finishing ’ finishing
- **Tool change optimization**: Minimize tool changes by grouping operations
- **Setup sheet generation**: Automatic creation of setup instructions and tool lists

### CNC Shark Specific Features
- **Dust collection optimization**: Tool paths that consider dust extraction efficiency
- **Manual tool change workflow**: Streamlined process for M0 pauses and tool measurement
- **Workpiece coordinate system helpers**: Visual aids for setting up part zeros
- **TAP file validation**: Pre-export checking for CNC Shark controller compatibility

## Future Enhancement Areas to Research

### Based on User Feedback Analysis
- Monitor common support questions and error reports
- Identify repetitive manual tasks that could be automated
- Track which features are underutilized and may need better UX
- Analyze workflow bottlenecks through user session data

### Integration Opportunities
- Direct integration with popular design software (Fusion 360, SolidWorks, etc.)
- Cloud-based material database with community contributions
- Integration with tool suppliers for automatic tool data updates
- Connection to CNC Shark community forums and knowledge base
